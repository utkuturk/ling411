probability of coin on monday > generic monday
joint probability Pr(coin, Monday) / Pr(Monday)
                  Pr(coin|Monday) the same thing

coin fairness is = .5
buttered toast Pbt > .5

english dative? preference for np or pp? the question of animacy?
Pnp > 0.5

P(NP|animate) > P(NP|inanimate)

WE NEED TO TRANSLATE THE QUESTIONS INTO QUESTIONS ABOUT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS OVER PARAMETERS.
probabilty of probability of the parameter being .5, given the data.
that s why we use bayesian.
p(hypothesis|data) = p(data|hypothesis) * p(hypothesis)
p(d|h) = p(h,d) / p(d)
p(h|d) = p(h,d) / p(h)

we essentially get this:

p(h|d) = (P(data|hypothesis)*p(hypothesis)) / p(data)

p(data) is the model. it is the small world. it is only in bayesian statistics. it is the plausability of the data given the my world knowledge. 

likelihood function, prior distribution, a way to combine them to arrive at a posterior distribution.

LIKELIHOOD
likelihood functions: bernoulli distributions: prb. of success where only one of 2 outcomes is possible. success or failure.
p(x=1) = p,P(x=0)=1 - p

binomial distribution: the prb of K successes in n trials where only one of 2 outcames is possible. parameters n p
for us: dbinom

other likelihood functions: poisson: is just like binominal. prb of K successes in a fixed interval of time, or area. 
for us: dpois

goussiaan: the distribution many sampling distributions converge to, as the sample size increases.
for us: dnorm

likelehood is closely related to the sampling distribution.
