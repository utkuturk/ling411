abstract = {Theoretical linguistics traditionally relies on linguistic intuitions such as grammatical-ity judgments for data. But the massive growth of language technologies has made the spontaneous use of language in natural settings a rich and easily accessible alter-native source of data. Moreover, studies of usage as well as intuitive judgments have shown that linguistic intuitions of grammaticality are deeply flawed, because (1) they seriously underestimate the space of grammatical possibility by ignoring the effects of multiple conflicting formal, semantic, and contextual constraints, and (2) they may re-flect probability instead of grammaticality. Both of these points are richly exemplified by studies of the English dative alternation (Green 1971; Gries 2003, 2005; Fellbaum 2005; Bresnan and Nikitina 2003; Bresnan, Cueni, Nikitina and Baayen in press; La-pata 1999; Bresnan and Hay 2006; Hay and Bresnan 2006), which is the linguistic domain of the present study. The present study discusses two experiments following up Bresnan et al. (in press). The first indicates that the " soft " generalizations found in corpus studies of the da-tive alternation reappear in subjects' intuitions of grammaticality in context, and that language users have substantial knowledge on the basis of these generalizations of what others are going to say (meaning here the choice of syntactic structure to convey the message). The second experiment shows that rare constructions that have been considered ungrammatical by many linguistic theorists are judged natural by speakers when the appropriate soft conditions are met. Intuitive constrasts in grammaticality that many linguists have reported seem to reflect probabilities rather than categorical constraints.},

abstract = {Theoretical linguists have traditionally relied on linguistic intuitions such as grammaticality judgments for their data. But the massive growth of computer-readable texts and recordings, the availability of cheaper, more powerful computers and software, and the development of new probabilistic models for language have now made the spontaneous use of language in natural settings a rich and easily accessible alternative source of data. Surprisingly, many linguists believe that such ‘usage data' are irrelevant to the theory of grammar. Four problems are repeatedly brought up in the critiques of usage data— 1. correlated factors seeming to support reductive theories, 2. pooled data invalidating grammatical inference, 3. syntactic choices reducing to lexical biases, and 4. cross-corpus differences undermining corpus studies. Presenting a case study of work on the English dative alternation, we show first, that linguistic intuitions of grammaticality are deeply flawed and seriously underestimate the space of grammatical possibility, and second, that the four problems in the critique of usage data are empirical issues that can be resolved by using modern statistical theory and modelling strategies widely used in other fields. The new models allow linguistic theory to solve more difficult problems than it has in the past, and to build convergent projects with psychology, computer science, and allied fields of cognitive science.},

abstract = {The present study addresses the gradience of the dative alternation. It is shown that central evidential paradigms that have been used to sup-port semantic explanations for the choice of dative constructions are not well founded empirically. Some widely repeated reports of intu-itive contrasts in grammaticality appear to rest instead on judgments of pragmatic probabilities. An informational theory of the dative alter-nation is supported by the results of a corpus study on the distribution of person across dative NP and PP recipients in spoken English, and a formal model of the theory is given within the framework of stochastic Optimality Theory.},

@book{Huddleston2002,
abstract = {Publisher description: This book presents a new and comprehensive descriptive grammar of English, written by the principal authors in collaboration with an international research team of a dozen linguists in five countries. It represents a major advance over previous grammars by virtue of drawing systematically on the linguistic research carried out on English during the last forty years. It incorporates insights from the theoretical literature but presents them in a way that is accessible to readers without formal training in linguistics. It is based on a sounder and more consistent descriptive framework than previous large-scale grammars, and includes much more explanation of grammatical terms and concepts, together with justification for the ways in which the analysis differs from traditional grammar. The book contains twenty chapters and a guide to further reading. Its usefulness is enhanced by diagrams of sentence structure, cross-references between sections, a comprehensive index, and user-friendly design and typography throughout. Preliminaries / Geoffrey K. Pullum and Rodney Huddleston -- Syntactic overview ; The verb ; The clause : complements / Rodney Huddleston -- Nouns and noun phrases / John Payne and Robert Huddleston -- Adjectives and adverbs ; Prepositions and preposition phrases / Geoffrey K.
